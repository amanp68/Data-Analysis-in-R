## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Ted_Talk_str}
library(readr)
Ted_Talk <- read_csv("~/Desktop/Assignments /Semester 2/Intro to analytics R programming/Ted Talk Data/Ted_Talk.csv")
View(Ted_Talk)
attach(Ted_Talk)
str(Ted_Talk) #printing the structure of the dataset
```

```{r Ted_Talk_ls}
ls(Ted_Talk) #listing the variables of the datasets
```
```{r Ted_Talk_summary}
summary(Ted_Talk) #listing the variables of the datasets
```
```{r Ted_Talk_head}

```
```{r Ted_Talk_author}

```{r Ted_Talk_library}

```{r Ted_Talk_drop}

```{r Ted_Talk_rename}
